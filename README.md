# HTTP Request with CJSON Example

Uses a POSIX socket to make a very simple HTTP request.

The HTTP request is performed on the OpenWeatherMap site and the JSON is obtained.

Afterwards, the JSON information is parsed using CJSON. In this example, temperature and the weather status is 
printed on the terminal.
